# Your website!

Below is the overview for using the create-react-app bootstrap - the most popular way to start a React project. I've deleted a lot of the stuff they use to simplify it, but it's useful for learning. You will need to use command line to locally start a server to view the site, using the `npm start` listed below. 

I've commented in places to try to explain what's going on, I hope it's helpful. You only need to pay attention to the `src` folder. `components` are for JS files for different parts of the site (which is technically in JSX, a JavaScript format that allows for you to esentially embed HTML). `styles` is for the CSS, but I use something called Sass, in `.scss` file format, just because I find it easier to look at - you can do a ton with it, but I'm really just using it to nest styles and saved a couple of varibles in that file so you can easily change some layout stuff if you want. `images` is self-explanatory - you could make another folder if you have videos or other media, for example. I would also often have a `fonts` folder, but I installed Barlow in the project, so it's almost liked an external tool that's imported. 

The file structure starts at the index.js file!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
